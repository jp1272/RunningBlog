      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I graduated from Berry College in 2024 where I ran Cross Country and
        Track. I was able to be a part of an incredible team that was able to
        maximize the success of what felt like every member of 20+ person
        roster. I have since been dealing with the lows of running without a
        team and without a championship to look forward to you can imagine or
        maybe relate to the motivation swings I have gone through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since college I have been balancing work, relationships, and my
        eagerness to hold onto running. Training looks a lot different, racing
        is inconsistent and not always planned, and the resources I have
        compared to the college days are little to none. But my goals to run
        fast and participate in the sport I love continue.

        Boston has been one of my goals for a while now and with the increased
        participation in marathons, the qualifying times will just keep getting
        faster. Nonetheless I have aspirations to qualify and race hard in 2026.
        Follow along as I share my journey.
