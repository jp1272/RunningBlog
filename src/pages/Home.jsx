        Running is a practice that not only required lots of time and effort but
        discipline to make time to put in the effort. This blog will document my
        journey through qualifying, resting, then getting back in shape to race
        the Boston Marathon

        Stick around for updates on the highs and lows and I hope that you can
        find motivation to tackle your next challenge through following along.
